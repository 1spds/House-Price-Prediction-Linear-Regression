# House-Price-Prediction-Linear-Regression
A beginner-friendly machine learning project that uses Linear Regression to predict housing prices based on various features in the California Housing dataset.

## Objective:
To build and evaluate a Linear Regression model that predicts median house prices in California districts based on various socio-economic and geographic features.

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to **predict housing prices in California** using **Linear Regression**, a fundamental machine learning algorithm for regression problems. The dataset contains various housing-related features such as location (latitude and longitude), total rooms, population, median income, and the median house value (our target variable).

### Project Workflow:

1. **Objective**  
   We define the goal of the project: to build a predictive model for estimating housing prices based on available features.

2. **About this File**  
   A brief overview of the dataset, which includes housing data for California from the 1990 U.S. Census.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   We explore the dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, correlations, and gain insights into the features that may influence house prices.

4. **Preprocessing**  
   This step involves selecting features and the target variable, handling missing values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

5. **Model Building**  
   A Linear Regression model is trained using the training dataset to learn the relationships between features and house values.

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   We evaluate the model's performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Additionally, we visualize the results through:
   - **Actual vs Predicted Plot** to assess model accuracy  
   - **Residual Plot** to detect bias or patterns in errors

7. **Deployment**  
   The trained model is saved and later reloaded to make predictions on new data, simulating how the model could be used in a real-world application.

8. **Conclusion**  
   We summarize the modelâ€™s performance, key findings, and provide suggestions for future improvements like using advanced models or adding more informative features.
